# T3PH 
## The TTRPG Handler

---

**T3ph** is meant to be an extensible table-top roleplaying game handler written in Python that automates most of the 
data recording normally done on paper, and the data processing handled by dice rolling. It is both a system in it's own right 
and a method to implement different settings using rules that can be as simple or in-depth as you'd like.

## NOTE

This is more of just a proof-of-concept at the moment. There will be major changes coming in the near future, but feel free 
to try out the system and poke around a bit!

## Requirements

**T3ph** requires [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) 
to be installed and running locally at `localhost:27017` (default host and port). Additionally, `pymongodb` is required and 
can be installed through [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html) using the requirements file which is provided 
and the command `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`
