# T3PH 
## The TTRPG Handler

---

**T3ph** is meant to be an extensible table-top roleplaying game handler written in Python that automates most of the 
data recording normally done on paper, and the data processing handled by dice rolling. It is both a system in it's own right 
and a method to implement different settings using rules that can be as simple or in-depth as you'd like.
